## What does this code do?
- apply a sliding window on a DataFrame
- flatten the 2D window into 1D vector
## Why?
- to make the data-set more compatible with Scikit-Learn and Keras
- apply feature normalization and SMOTE techniques
## how?
- make sure your data-set has the similar shape as the example
- run the jupyter code on your data-set
here is a link to my youtube channle where I explain the code
